        <h3>Sep. 25, 2020</h3>
        <p>It was a gorgeous day in the neighborhood when I ran into Mr. Rodgers. He was chipper as usual, and we had a lovely chat. Then everything changed
        when the fire nation attacked. Prince Zuko started whipping out some sick ninjitsu, but then Mr. Rodgers broke out his sharingan. The showdown could not be more intense
        as I struggled to make my way to the dragon ballz. But with my trusty bakugan and Asta by my side, we were able to survive the onslaught of Hollows.</p>

        <h3>Sep. 26, 2020</h3>
        <p>In the aftermath of the battle the previous day against various ficticious elements from the creative minds of Japan (bar Mr. Rodgers, that actually happened),
        both the "reel deal" and I realized that we had to turn in this blog to a CS 260 TA that actually had to read what we had written down here. We frantically scrambled
        do figure out how to delete html code from out Atom code editor, but then realize that it was a really easy thing to do. In the end, we decided to keep the Blog
        post as is to either the delight or the confusion of the poor soul that actually had to read it. Bless you.</p>
